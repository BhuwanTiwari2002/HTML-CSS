                <h2>Software Developer</h2>
                <p>Software developers retrieve, store, and manipulate data in order to analyze the capability and requirements of a system. 
                   They are in charge of the design and maintenance of a software system. </p>

                <h2>Introduction of myself and Education</h2>
                <p> I recently graduated from Tesla Charter Engineering School and East High School. To further my education, 
                    I am attending Fox Valley Technical College for software developer. I was born in a small village in Nepal called Madi. 
                    Nepal is a very underdeveloped country, for that reason I didn't know what a computer was until I turned 9 years old. 
                    After I got my hands on a computer, it was like magic, I couldn't believe the things it could do. Around the age of 10, 
                    I got to come to the United States. After having more exposure to computers, I just knew deep down that I wanted to work 
                    with computers. I hope to inspire a kid like me in the future.

                <h2>Future plans and experience</h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first year of college, I have two more years until I can get my associate degree. After receiving my associate degree, 
                    I want to transfer to UW Madison for a bachelor's degree. I do have a little experience in programming, I joined the software team 
                    in robotics. I am fairly new to HTML and CSS, in robotics we mostly focused on java. Furthermore, I hope to have good knowledge in HTML
                     and CSS by the end of this semester. So far, I am really enjoying HTML and CSS, it's different from java.
                </p>
                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>My favorite hobbies in the summer include camping, swimming and hiking. I enjoy taking photos of nature and being creative with my pictures. 
                    During the quarantine I played a lot of games like Minecraft and Fortnite. I also enjoy playing soccer with my friends, and going to Parker 
                    John's BBQ & Pizza.</p>
                <h2>Dreams/Memories</h2>
                <p>My dream is to start my own business and create Tiwari foundation to help individuals in need. My favorite memory was when I went to 
                    Nepal in 2019 and got to meet all my family after 7 years. It was the best experience I ever had. Now I live with my mom, dad, sister 
                    and brother. I do have family relatives all over the state. I also remember going camping and just loving being out in the woods.
