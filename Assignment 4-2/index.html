            <h1>Why I love to travel</h1>
            <p> Traveling allows me to eat food from different locations and experience different cultures. Going out and exploring nature has been a dream since I was a kid.
                One of the reasons I wanted to become a software developer was traveling. I hope to one day join a company that allows me to travel the world and code at the same 
                time. When I travel it gives me a perceptive on other living standards. </p>
            <h1>Favorite Travel Experience</h1>
            <p>I really like going to New York, it is different from Wisconsin. There are many restaurants and shops, very convenient. The food in New York was different,
                I really enjoyed there pizza's. I also loved Arizona, beautiful houses and very peaceful.  </p>
