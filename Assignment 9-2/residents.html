                    desirable place to live, work and visit. Our mission is to "Be a model of modern police services built upon a
                    strong partnership with the community using respect, creativity and technology to find solutions and
                    improve the quality of life and safety for all". We work towards our mission every day by using the Procedural

                    service, every traffic stop and every issue that we are asked to assist with.
