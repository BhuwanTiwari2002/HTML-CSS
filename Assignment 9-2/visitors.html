                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Treaties with the Menominee Indians opened land to the east of the Fox River for public sale in 1835,
                    with territorial governor James Doty being one of the early investors and purchasers of land in the
                    area. In 1848 Doty and his associates, including Curtis Reed, formed the village of Menasha on the channel
                    north of the island. In 1849 Reed and Doty were successful in locating the navigational channel of the
                    Fox-Wisconsin waterway through the north channel in Menasha. In 1854 Menasha approved $150,000 in bonding to bring
                    the Manitowoc & Mississippi Railroad to town with the intention of establishing Menasha as the principal
                    transportation axis in Wisconsin both in water and rail. The early 1900's saw a shift to industrial production of
                    general and specialized papers and kept the economy strong, even through the great depression. Today, Menasha
                    continues to be home to some of the world's largest corporations as well as innovative local companies
                    including: SCA, Donnelley, IPG, Orbis (Menasha Corporation), Coveris, Sonoco, Affinity, Advanced Tool, Simply
                    Incredible, McClone, and Faith Technologies.
