                <h2>History of Menasha?</h2>
                <p> White settlers came to Menasha as early as 1835 and it was incorporated as a city in 1874.
                    The city became a center for wooden ware products using water power provided by the river.
                    The Menasha Wooden Ware Company was, at one time, the world's largest producer of wooden
                    ware products. In later years, companies switched from wood products to paper manufacturing.
                    Menasha is located at the mouth of the Fox River on the northern tip of Lake Winnebago in Winnebago
                    County. The city nearly surrounds all of Little Lake Butte des Morts and Doty Island is located partially in
                    Menasha. Mrs. Doty, the wife of territorial governor James Duane Doty (1799-1865), named the site after the
                    Native American word for "The Island."</p>
