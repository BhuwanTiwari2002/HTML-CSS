    <h4>Defense carries Wisconsin to 27-7 triumph over No. 9 Iowa</h4>
    <blockquote>MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Graham Mertz scored on two quarterback sneaks and threw a touchdown pass to help
    Wisconsin trounce No. 9 Iowa 27-7 on Saturday for its fourth consecutive victory. Wisconsin forced three turnovers, 
    produced six sacks and limited Iowa to 24 yards rushing. The Badgers maintained control of their destiny in the Big Ten 
    West Division race and regained possession of the Heartland Trophy that goes to the winner of this annual matchup. 
    Iowa has lost two straight games.</blockquote>

    <h4>Brewers coach retires after 30 years with the team</h4>
    <blockquote>After 30 years with the team, Brewers coach Ed Sedar announced his retirement Monday.
    “Being able to spend 30 years with one organization is something I will always cherish. I appreciate 
    everyone who has been there for me and helped along the way. I wish the organization the best going forward. 
    They are in great hands. Most of all, I will miss the best fans in sports,” Sedar said in a news release. Sedar 
    started as the Brewers' Minor League outfield and baserunning coordinator in 1992, where he stayed through 2006.
    During those years, he also worked as the Minor League field coordinator and a manager for two of the Brewers' 
    rookie-level affiliates. He won Pioneer League Manager of the Year for his work at Rookie Helena in 2003.

    <h4>Davante Adams moved to COVID-19 list</h4>
    <blockquote>GREEN BAY (WKOW) -- Shortly after defensive coordinator Joe Barry announced he had contracted COVID-19, 
    the Green Bay Packers moved star wide receiver Davante Adams to the reserve/COVID-19 list. According to a post on the
    team's official website, the NFL Players' Association does not allow teams to comment on a player's medical status aside 
    from their roster status. Adams' status on the list does not necessarily mean he has contracted the coronavirus, he may 
    simply be a close contact. The move interrupts another strong start for Adams, one of the top wide receivers in the NFL. 
    Through the first seven games, Adams has 744 receiving yards and three touchdowns.
