            <h2>About Hean Meat</h2>
            <p>Haen Meat Packing, Inc. was established as a family owned and operated business in 1959. After years of 
            experience operating the plant for his brother Leo, Jack Haen and his wife Patricia purchased it in 1975.</p>
            <p>Built on a strong tradition of product and service quality, the business continues to grow. The facility has 
            expanded several times to accommodate customer demand and to include Jack & Pat's four sons. After the sudden 
            death of their father in 1996, Dan, John, Tim and Tom Haen formed an equal partnership and continue to run the 
            operation with the same family traditions and high standards that were set for them by their parents.</p>
            <p>Quality products, customer satisfaction and the highest sanitation standards are just a few of the key ingredients 
            in Haen's recipe for success. Haen Meats is a full service meat market featuring custom slaughtering, the finest 
            meat cuts, and a huge selection of cured and smoked meats and sausage products made from their own family recipes. 
            The company has earned over 370 State, National and State Fair awards, including 10 Best of Shows- the highest award
            given by the Wisconsin Association of Meat Processors in their Cured Meat Product Competition. Haen Meats has also
            earned a reputation that keeps customers coming back and welcomes new customers on a regular basis.</p>
