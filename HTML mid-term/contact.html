            <p>There are about 3,334 Employees. The company has been operational for 13 years now.
                The founders of the company were Lloyd Frink and Rich Barton. The company's primary business model
                is to create revenue by selling advertisements on its online website. In the year 2009, the company
                had collaborated with almost 180 newspapers in the USA in order to lend its own real estate search
                engine to the online websites of these newspapers. This was a part of the project known as Zillow
                Newspaper Consortium. The company used to share the advertising revenue from the co-branded online
                websites along with newspapers and therefore extends its overall reach into the local markets as well.
