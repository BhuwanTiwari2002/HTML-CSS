    <h4>Mobile: (920) 476-7300 </h4>
    <p> Recently I made the decision to follow a lifelong passion and join Expert Real Estate Partners. 
        A Wisconsin native, I received my undergraduate degree from Marian University in Fond du Lac. 
        I am especially connected to Northeast, Central, and Northern Wisconsin areas through immediate 
        and extended family, friends, and professional, and personal associations. My individual 
        engagement in home, the Fox Valley community, and the market allow me a depth of understanding 
        of area neighborhoods, school districts, and on-going economic development across the Fox Valley.
        Organized and tenacious, I have been praised by my clients for my resourcefulness, veracity and 
        dedication. My business tenet is very simply to assume the client’s priorities as my own. I use
        experiences from my other professional and personal journeys to ensure that the client’s real 
        estate experiences are positive, and their objectives are met. Educating clients along the way 
        is one of my priorities. </p>
