                <h2>Families</h2>
                <p> First and foremost, thank you for choosing the Appleton Area School District.
                    Our goal is to build a sense of community and trust between children, parents, and staff. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> It is through the collaborative efforts of the community that we continue to grow as an
                    organization and meet the needs of our students. Please consider joining us in achieving
                    this goal. Your participation is encouraged and welcomed as we shape our District together.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> Our schools rely on many attributes to maintain and to improve the quality of its educational
                    programs. A supportive community, successful business partnerships, a highly qualified staff,
                    and a dedicated Board of Education all play an essential role in educating today’s students
                    and tomorrow’s citizens and leaders. However, we believe that you are your child’s first and
                    most important teacher. Your effective communication with your child’s teacher(s) and the
                    principal is critical in building a strong partnership. We encourage you to be an active
                    participant in your child’s learning.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> Our goal is to build a relationship both with the child
                    and with the family. We like to foster connections between the child's day at school and
                    life at home. We invite you to share your ideas, questions, and concerns with us. We
                    hope you will visit the classroom, participate in events, volunteer and share aspects of
                    your family life with us. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> We know that it is our relationships with our students and families that are at the
                    foundation for new learning. So, as we work to improve our instructional practice,
                    we are equally committed to providing a safe and welcoming school environment for all
                    of our students. </p>
