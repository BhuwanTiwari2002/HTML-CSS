                <br>
                <h2>What is the mission of Tesla Charter Enginnering School</h2>
                <p> The mission of Tesla Engineering Charter School is to integrate a broad exposure to the field
                    of engineering and technology with a balanced high school experience and to prepare those with
                    the aptitude and passion to pursue post-secondary education and careers in science, technology,
                    engineering, and math. Our partners support and serve our school in a variety of capacities.
                    Most have members of their company or organization serving on the Tesla Charter Board.
                    These individuals make up a team that provides governance, guidance and develops the schoolâ€™s short
                    and long term strategic goals to best prepare our students for a technologically rich future.
                    In addition they provide learning opportunities beyond the classroom. </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Why should you choose a charter school?</h2>
                <p> Charter schools have unique freedom and flexibility not found in public school districts,
                    and their freedom from the red tape of public education often allows them to dedicate increased
                    resources and energy on supporting students in excelling academic standards.
                    A charter school can help a child excel through a more rigorous curriculum. While charter
                    schools have particular freedom in curriculum design and management, they are often held to
                    a higher standard than traditional public schools. Some educational benefit include
                    real world learning, customizied curriculum promotion of Inclusion and Community Involvement
                    and more. </p>
