                <h3>21-22 School Year Infomation</h3>
                <p> The Appleton Area School District has established protocols for mitigating the spread of
                    COVID-19 while prioritizing the continuity of in-person, academic, and social-emotional
                    learning for all students five days a week. Minimizing social disruption for students, families,
                    and staff and utilizing layered mitigation strategies will be the focus this fall. These
                    strategies are based on the following factors: community transmission, vaccination rates,
                    internal case data, and availability of PCR testing in schools. We have also reviewed
                    guidance from the district’s medical advisor and CDC/DHS/Local Public Health Guidance. The
                    District Leadership Team will collaborate with public health officials to review cases and
                    data on a continuous basis with a representative school nurse to discuss trends and mitigation
                    strategy implementation to address any increased transmission of COVID-19. Flexibility
                    within recommended protocols may be needed in order to achieve our goals.
                    If an adjustment to mitigation strategies is needed, they will be targeted and responsive
                    to the specific situation within our classrooms, schools, programs, or facilities.
                    If needed, any updated expectations will be communicated to staff and families as soon
                    as possible.

                <h3>Welcome to New Board Members</h3>
                <p> At the August 23, 2021 Board meeting, two new Board members were appointed. We welcome James
                    Bacon and Amanda Stuck to the AASD Board of Education! James began his career as a middle
                    school math teacher in a small Arkansas town, where he also fundraised over $20,000 in six
                    months to take some of his students to Washington DC. Since then, he’s also coached teachers
                    across almost all grades and subjects in K-12, overseen hiring for Boston Public Schools, and
                    founded Teach For America region in northeast Louisiana, where he recruited and trained teachers
                    in underserved areas. Amanda was born in Appleton, Wisconsin, and is married with two children.
                    She is a graduate of Appleton North High School and attended Fox Valley Technical College;
                    she received her B.A. in Political Science from the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in 2007
                    and her Master of Public Administration degree from University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in 2012.

                <h3>21-22 School Year: Free School Meals for All</h3>
                <p> We are happy to share that all AASD students will once again have access to healthy meals free
                    of charge this school year, as a federal waiver remains in effect through the 2021-22 school
                    year. However, PLEASE still fill out a Free & Reduced form, even if you are not sure if you
                    qualify. These annual forms are necessary for other programs and may be used to determine if
                    your household is eligible for additional benefits. The forms can be completed online through
                    the Parent Portal as well. When logging into the Portal, the Free and Reduced Meal Benefits
                    Application is also available on the center panel under "Meal Benefits". Back in April,
                    the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced they extended the Child Nutrition Program
                    waivers that allow schools needed flexibility to ensure children have continued access
                    to free meals at school through June 30, 2022, regardless of their ability to pay.
                    The AASD applied for this waiver, and we have been approved.
